Thanks for taking the time to read the read me file and looking at my page!

I chose to use bootstrap on my final assigment as this was going to be more of a challenge and learning experience than just using HTML and CSS. Although most of bootstrap made it easy to format there were a few challenges that I faced. The nav bar was challening to make a hamburger menu and then turn it into inline on the right hand side. By adding Margin left auto (ml-auto), it neatly placed everything over to the right hand side. 

Creating the icons in the footer with equal spacing was also a bit tricky and tried a plethora of ways. By adding a bootstrap grid and making the all col 3 and 4 items made them equally spaced out and works well.

Once mastering the grid system with bootstrap and understanding that every row needs a col, it started to come together and was excited that it was so easy to use. 

The one issue I was not able to overcome (and hesitant to indicate the issue for fear of lower marks haha) was the words over the banners. I was able to add the text and center it I was not able to make it change in desktop to the left and ultimately just removed the wording altogether. 

Thank you for the lovely semester.
